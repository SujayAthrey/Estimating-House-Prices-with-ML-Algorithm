# Estimating-House-Prices-with-ML-Algorithm

This C program essentially implements a simple machine learning algorithm that is used to predict the price of a house given its multiple attributes and characteristics. This includes the square footage of the house, the number of bedrooms/bathrooms, along with how recent it was built (or if it was newly constructed). The machine learning algorithm learns how to correctly estimate a house price by being "trained" on historical data. 

The historical data is provided under a seperate file, where the house prices associated with a certain size/#of rooms/year constructed are listed. Here the algorithm is able to build a correct relationship between the house prices and attributes which is how it is used to estimate future house prices
